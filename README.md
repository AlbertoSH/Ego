# Ego


Compile time generated JavaORM for MongoDB â€” Edit

#### **Currently under development!!!**

Operations supported:

* Create
* Read (quite simple, though)

## Overview

**Ego** analyzes your models and generates classes for DB operations

---

## Roadmap

###Must have:

- Builder generation (**Done**)
- Codec generation (Half done, working on it...)
- Create class generation (**Done**)
- Read class generation (**Done**, very simple though, it will be improved with filter and sort operations)
- Delete class generation
- Filter class generation
- Patch class generation
- Update class generation

###Nice to have:

- Specify the collection name in the constructor

## How to start

1. Clone this repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/AlbertoSH/Ego.git`
2. Make your objects extend `EgoObject`
  * You have an example at `com.github.albertosh.ego.sample.SimpleItem`
3. Compile sample (or your code) with Gradle
  * `./gradlew ego-sample:compileJava`
4. The code generated is in `./ego-sample/build/generated/source/apt`
5. Create a `CodecRegistry` with all your codecs (**NOTE: This step will be done automatically in future versions**)
   
        List<Codec<?>> codecs = new ArrayList<>();
        codecs.add(new SimpleItemEgoCodec());
        ... // all your codecs
        CodecRegistry codecRegistry = CodecRegistries.fromRegistries(
                MongoClient.getDefaultCodecRegistry(),
                CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(codecs));


6. Instantiate a `MongoClient` including the `CodecRegistry`

        MongoClientOptions options = MongoClientOptions.builder()
                .codecRegistry(codecRegistry)
                .build();
        MongoClient client = new MongoClient("localhost:27017", options)

7. You can now create your I*EgoCreate, I*EgoRead classes with that `MongoClient` and a database name:
  * I recommend you to declare your variables as interfaces so you can change the implementation whenever you want 

                ISimpleItemEgoCreate create = new SimpleItemEgoCreate(client, "ego");
                ISimpleItemEgoRead read = new SimpleItemEgoRead(client, "ego");


**You have a use example at `test` folder**
